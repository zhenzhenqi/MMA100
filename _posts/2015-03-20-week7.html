    <h2>Virtual Reality as a Concept</h2>
    <blockquote>"The most elemental process of modern times is the conquest of the world as images."
    <footer>Martin Heidegger, Holzwege, p. 92. Frankfurt: Klostermann (1980).</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In virtual space, both historically and in the present, the illusion works on two levels: first, there is the classic function of illusion which is the playful and conscious submission to appearance that is the aesthetic enjoyment of illusion. Second, by intensifying the suggestive image effects and through appearance, this can temporarily overwhelm perception of the difference between mage space and reality. This suggestive power may, for a certain time, suspend the relationship between subject and object, and the "as if" may have effects on awareness. The power of a hitherto unknown or perfected medium of illusion to deceive the senses leads the observer to act or feel according to the scene or logic of the images and, to a certain degree, may even succeed in captivating awareness. This is the starting point for historic illusion spaces and their immersive successors in art and media history. They use mutlimedia to increase and maximize suggestion in order to erode the inner distance of the observer and ensure maximum effect for their message.</p>
