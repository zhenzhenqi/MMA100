    <h2>Media History</h2>
    <a href="https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/media-timeline-most-important-inventions-in-media-history">Interactive Media Timeline</a>
    <p>The scale of recent and current encroachment of media and technology into the workplace and work processes is a far greater upheaval than other epochs have known, and, obviously, it has also affected large areas of art. Media art, that is, video, computer graphics and animation, Net-art, interactive art in its most advanced form of virtual art with its subgenres of telepresence art and genetic art, is beginning to dominate theories of the image and art. We are experiencing the rise of the com- puter-generated, virtual spatial image to image per se, to images that appear capable of autonomous change and of formulating a lifelike, all- embracing visual and sensory sphere. As yet, digital art still exists in a state of limbo, rather like photography before Stieglitz.</p>

         <p>The Persistence of Memory (Spanish: La persistencia de la memoria; Catalan: La persistència de la memòria) is a 1931 painting by artist Salvador Dalí, and is one of his most recognizable works. The well-known surrealist piece introduced the image of the soft melting pocket watch.[2] It epitomizes Dalí's theory of "softness" and "hardness", which was central to his thinking at the time. As Dawn Ades wrote, "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order".[3] This interpretation suggests that Dalí was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. </p>

    <p> The computer is procedural, participatory, encyclopedic, and spatial. This means it can embody
rules and execute them; it allows us to manipulate its objects; it can contain more information in more forms than any previous medium; and it can create a world that we can navigate and even inhabit as well as
observe. - Janet Murray</p>
