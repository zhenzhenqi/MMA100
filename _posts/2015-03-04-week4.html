    <h2>The Gestalt Principles</h2>
    <p>Gestalt is a psychology term which means "unified whole". It refers to theories of visual perception developed by German psychologists in the 1920s. These theories attempt to describe how people tend to organize visual elements into groups or unified wholes when certain principles are applied.</p>

    <h5>Similarity</h5>
    <p>Similarity occurs when objects look similar to one another. People often perceive them as a group or pattern.</p>

    <h2>Element of Design: Value</h2>
    <p>The term value is used in the language of Art to refer to the "value" of light. The more light, the higher the the value. White is the highest or lightest value.On the other hand , black is the lowest or darkest value. Colors have value as well. Yellow for example has a relatively high (light) value, while violet has a relatively low value (dark).</p>
    <p>Value is very important to drawing and painting because value changes are what creates contrast. Contrast is needed to help us see and understand a two dimensional work of art. For example, if the was no value contrast between the words on this page and the background; you would have difficulty reading what is here.</p>
    <p>Value contrasts can also create interest in art works. Our eyes tend to be drawn to areas of hign contrast, so artists use this to show us what they think is important.</p>
    <p>Dark areas tend to denote
        <br>gloom
        <br>mystery
        <br>drama
        <br>menace
    </p>
    <p>Light areas tend to denote
        <br>happiness
        <br>fun
        <br>gaiety
        <br>warmth
        <br>closeness
    </p>
