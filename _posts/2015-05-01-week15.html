        <p>Snake is a game where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. There is no standard version of the game. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and its simplicity has led to many implementations (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title). After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest in the Snake concept as it found a larger audience.</p>

    <h2>Utility Game</h2>
    <p>Utility games, as the name implies, attempt to teach the user using the game as a vehicle to achieve learning and growth related Objectives. Lots of of these types of games target young users from the ages of about three years to mid-teens;past the mid-teens, subjects become so complex that teaching via a game is impractical. Numerous subgenres exist, in fields such as math or typing. Other games targeting adults aim at changing specific behavior or points of view on specific activities.</p>

    <h2>Art Game</h2>
    <p>An art game is a work of interactive new media digital software art as well as a member of the "art game" subgenre of the serious video game. The term "art game" was first used academically in 2002 and it has come to be understood as describing a video game designed to emphasize art or whose structure is intended to produce some kind of reaction in its audience.[3] Art games are interactive[4] (usually competitive against the computer, self, or other players[5]), and they are the result of artistic intent by the party offering the piece for consideration.[6] They also typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design.[7] The concept has been extended by some art theorists to the realm of modified ("modded") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non-art-games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling. Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as "video game art."      </p>
