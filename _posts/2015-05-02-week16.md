## Interaction Design - Prototyping

### Storyboard

What is a storyboard? And what kind of design benefit from a storyboarding process? 
A storyboard is a graphic organizer in the form of illustrations or images displayed in sequence for the purpose of pre-visualizing a motion picture,animation, motion graphic or interactive media sequence. The storyboarding process, in the form it is known today, was developed at Walt Disney Productions during the early 1930s, after several years of similar processes being in use at Walt Disney and other animation studios. One advantage of using storyboards is that it allows (in film and business) the user to experiment with changes in the storyline to evoke stronger reaction or interest. Flashbacks, for instance, are often the result of sorting storyboards out of chronological order to help build suspense and interest.


Use How to create a storyboard? You can hand-draw low-fidelity storyboard on paper and digitize it. Web applications like [storyboard this](https://www.storyboardthat.com/storyboard-creator) can also assist with creating a digital narrative. It can be a comic book project you've always wanted to explore, or a concept you had for a video game, an art installation, a cellphone app you are interested in exploring. See below for inspirations and examples.

### Wireframe
What is wireframe and what kind of design benefit from an wire-framing process? Wireframes are simple black and white layouts that outline the specific size and placement of page elements, site features, conversion areas and navigation for your web site. They are devoid of color, font choices, logos or any real design elements that take away from purely focusing on a siteâ€™s structure. We often say that they are much like a blue print to a home, where you can easily see the structural placement of your plumbing, electrical and other structural elements without any interior design treatments. Wireframing is very helpful in a multitude of ways. Your designs are more calculated and streamlined. Content creation becomes much clearer. You avoid hacks later on in the design process. You avoid situations where you spend hours crafting a specific screen design only to realize that it's not relevant to your overall user flow much later on during the design process.

How to design a wireframe? There are lots of choices for wireframing Apps. [moqups](https://moqups.com/) is a web based wireframe design app you can use.

<div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <img src="{{ '/img/week16/wireframe1.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <img src="{{ '/img/week16/wireframe2.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="img-responsive">
            </div>

## Assignment - Prototyping for Interaction Design
Depending on if you are making a commercial(functional) web/app mockup, or a narrative based mockup, choose one of the following prototyping approaches to make a 4-6 page low-fidelity wireframe and bring it on Monday. At the initial prototyping stage, it is very important to focus on the overall narrative, user interaction and follow. Don't think too much about the details yet.  Also, if you think your app will benefit from both a storyboard and a wireframe, prototype with both. If you have digital creatives you created in the past, ie., photos you have taken, paintings you have drawn, illustrator/photoshop designs, and you would like to use them to mock up your final project, make sure you bring them on next class. During class, we will work on visual mockup together based on the wireframe/storyboard you have created.

Please see below for a short paragraph that you can paraphrase and expand into the final presentation for your APP design project.
  
As a graphic designer, I am interested in using digital visual communication to explore/research/express _________________ . I got interested in this topic when/because ___________________ . I would like my audience to feel __________________ when they interact with my App. I have researched into a few similar projects/artists/designers, such as _________________ . Visually, I iterated over a few rounds of design. I first designed ______________ . Then, I decided to keep ______________ and change _________________ in order to achieve ________________ . Finally, I designed ________________ . What I love about this design is _______________ . IF there is more time, I would like to work on ___________________ . From this project, I learned a few things about what kind of designer/artist/visual storyteller I am: ____________________ .

Below is a more specific checklist to refer to during the final design phase, and preparing for final presentation. Depending on the nature of your design, only part of this list may apply to you.
    
#### Visual Style
 
* Do I have a consistent visual style across all pages?
* When multiple graphics styles are used on the same page, are they concious design decisions with good reason? ie., graphic vs. photo-realistic, abstract vs. discriptive etc.
* What's them main and ambience color theme? Is the color theme implemented consistently accross all pages?

#### Layout

* Does each page have a good layout design?
* Do sizes of different visual elements on the same page complement each other well?
* Are rows and columns well aligned?
* Are there consistent margins and paddings around rows, columns, paralell visual elements?
* Is there enough contrast between first and secondary level of visual information on the page?
* Are their sufficient negative space reserved for each page?
    
#### Typography

* What size of font did I choose for main title, subtitle, buttons etc?
* What display font and text font did I choose for title and paragraph for each page?
* Do the choices of fonts and size compliment each other well? Are they readable, legible, and contribute to the overall visual style of the design?

    
#### Image

* If I am using multiple external images, what are their values, ie., contrast, hue, Saturations?
* Is it necessary to use adjustment layers to tone these images.
* Are they being used at original ratio?

    
#### Information Architecture

* How many pages do I have in total? In what order are they arranged?
* What information is on each page and Why?
* Does the first page(landing page) clearly communicate the overall app experience/narrative to the user?
* If it is a narrative based experience, how does it come to an end?

#### User Experience

* Is it clear how user can navigate between different sections/pages? 
* Are their enough choices to convey user agency?
* Are their enough visual detail for user to feel immersed?
