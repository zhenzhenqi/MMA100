    <h2>Layout and Composition</h2> As human beings, we look instinctively for pattern and meaning. With the exception of a few people on hoarding reality shows, most of us organize our world to make sense. We put the towels with the other towels in the linen closet. We don't put some in the freezer and others under the bed. We organize our books by subject, author, or color. These actions make life more manageable. This is the core idea of a grid and consistent proportions. The grid helps the designer organize the information with hierarchy and order.
    <br>Consistent proportions provide a visual sense of unity and clarity. A grid is the same as the steel frame of a building underneath the walls and windows. It holds the structure together without being dominant. When we apply a grid to a project, the elements are arranged in a way that makes sense. The text is placed consistently and images relate to each other in scale. Now, imagine a world without grids and consistent proportions.</p>
