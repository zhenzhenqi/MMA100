    <h2>Element of Design: Space and Perspective</h2>
<p>The Element of Design Space refers to the area within, around, above or below an object or objects. It is important to creating and understanding both two dimensional or three dimensional works of art. With three dimensional art the space things occupy is real as is the space around object. In two dimensional art this is definitely not the case. Two dimensionall art exists on a flat surface, so if something looks three dimensional- it is an illusion! Even the most realistic paintings or photographs are illusions. Two dimensional artists use a number of "tricks" for creating the illusion of depth in their art.</p>

    <h2>Linear Perspective</h2>
    <p>Linear perspective is a depth cue that is related to both relative size and the next depth cue, texture gradient. In linear perspective parallel lines that recede into the distance appear to get closer together or converge.</p>
    
    <h5>Viewpoint</h5>
    <p>This is the basic positioning of your eyes, just like pointing a camera. What's the best Line of sight, the straight line between you, the Observer, and the Object or focal point of the scene before you? Study and consider what you're looking at. Is this the best viewpoint to find the best composition? Where are you physically in relation to the scene you are considering painting? Are you elevated, looking downward at your subject? Are you looking up? Standing, sitting, or kneeling? Flying?</p>

    <h5>Horizon</h5>
    <p>See where the sky meets the land? That's the horizon line. It's on the horizon. If objects are blocking your view of the horizon line, turn around until you can determine where it is in relation to your line of sight and extend that knowledge into your chosen view.</p>
    <img src="{{ '/img/week3/horizon.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="img-responsive">  
      <hr>  
    <h5>Vanishing Point</h5>
    <h5>The vanishing point is a point in the far distance at which your eyes can no longer see. Since the farthest we can see here is to the earth's horizon that's where most vanishing points live. Perspective lines start at the vanishing point.</h5>

    <h2>Design Assignment - Use Repetition, Alignment, Scale, and Value to represent a spacial concept</h2>
    <p>Set up a perspective system in Photoshop - ask yourself where is horizon, vanishing point, and think about from what view point you are observing the scene.</p>
    <p>Recreate the Emotion drawing inside the Perspective Grid. For similar shapes, draw the shape once, make copies, .</p>
    <p>Adjust size, alignment, grayscale, transparency or color(if you are using them) to represent a spacial idea. Think of aligning these shapes in a virual 2 or 3 dimentional confinement.</p>
    <p>Be prepared to present your design from a personal and spacial perspective.</p>
