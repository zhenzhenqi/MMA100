    <h2>Element of Design: Space</h2>
<p>The Element of Design Space refers to the area within, around, above or below an object or objects. It is important to creating and understanding both two dimensional or three dimensional works of art. With three dimensional art the space things occupy is real as is the space around object. In two dimensional art this is definitely not the case. Two dimensionall art exists on a flat surface, so if something looks three dimensional- it is an illusion! Even the most realistic paintings or photographs are illusions. Two dimensional artists use a number of "tricks" for creating the illusion of depth in their art.</p>

    <h2>Element of Design: Value</h2>
    <p>The term value is used in the language of Art to refer to the "value" of light. The more light, the higher the the value. White is the highest or lightest value.On the other hand , black is the lowest or darkest value. Colors have value as well. Yellow for example has a relatively high (light) value, while violet has a relatively low value (dark).</p>
    <p>Value is very important to drawing and painting because value changes are what creates contrast. Contrast is needed to help us see and understand a two dimensional work of art. For example, if the was no value contrast between the words on this page and the background; you would have difficulty reading what is here.</p>
    <p>Value contrasts can also create interest in art works. Our eyes tend to be drawn to areas of hign contrast, so artists use this to show us what they think is important.</p>
