    <p> The computer is procedural, participatory, encyclopedic, and spatial. This means it can embody
rules and execute them; it allows us to manipulate its objects; it can contain more information in more forms than any previous medium; and it can create a world that we can navigate and even inhabit as well as
observe. - Janet Murray</p>

    <h2>Digital Narrative</h2>
    <p>The scale of recent and current encroachment of media and technology into the workplace and work processes is a far greater upheaval than other epochs have known, and, obviously, it has also affected large areas of art. Media art, that is, video, computer graphics and animation, Net-art, interactive art in its most advanced form of virtual art with its subgenres of telepresence art and genetic art, is beginning to dominate theories of the image and art. We are experiencing the rise of the com- puter-generated, virtual spatial image to image per se, to images that appear capable of autonomous change and of formulating a lifelike, all- embracing visual and sensory sphere. As yet, digital art still exists in a state of limbo, rather like photography before Stieglitz.</p>
