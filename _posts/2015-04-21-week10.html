    <h2>Vector Graphics</h2>
    <p>Vector graphics is the use of geometrical primitives such as points, lines, curves, and shapes or polygons—all of which are based on mathematical expressions—to represent images in computer graphics. Vector graphics are based on vectors (also called paths), which lead through locations called control points or nodes.</p>
    <p>The term vector graphics is typically used only for 2D (planar) graphics objects, in order to distinguish them from 2D raster graphics, which are also very common. 3D graphics as commonly implemented today (e.g., in OpenGL) are typically described using primitives like 3D points and polygons connecting these (which in turn describe surfaces); these 3D primitives are much more similar to vector graphics than to raster graphics, but aren't explicitly called vector graphics.</p>

    <h2>Raster Image</h2>
    <p>So far we have been working with Raster Image. As opposed to Vector Graphics which can be interpreted as a series of instructions to recreate a complex shape, Raster Image holds the information of each pixel contained in an image. The total number of pixel contained in an image determines its resolution. More pixels increase the resolution of the image.</p>
    <p>Pixels per inch (PPI) or pixels per centimeter (PPCM) is a measurement of the pixel density (resolution) of an electronic image device, such as a computer monitor or television display, or image digitizing device such as a camera or image scanner. Horizontal and vertical density are usually the same, as most devices have square pixels, but differ on devices that have non-square pixels. PPI can also describe the resolution, in pixels, of an image file. The unit is not square centimeters—a 100×100 pixel image printed in a 1 cm square has a resolution of 100 pixels per centimeter (ppcm).</p>
    <p>Industry standard, good quality photographs usually require 300 pixels per inch, at 100% size, when printed onto coated paper stock, using a printing screen of 150 lines per inch (lpi).</p>

    <h2>Assignment - Design</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Find an image, trace its shape in Illustrator using Pen tool and Direct Selection tool. Pen tool helps draw, add, delete anchor points and covert between sharp and rounded anchor points. Double Clicking any anchor point with direct selection tool moves it around or modifies its handle. When you are satisfied, hide the original image and save the tracing result into an .ai file.</li>
        <li>Open a new blank illustrator file, set it as 8 x 8 inch. Use guides, grids, primitive shapes and pathfinder tool to draw a more abstract vector graphic. Save it as a .ai file as well.</li>
        <li>Create an 8.5 x 11 inch Photoshop Canvas. Go to File==>Place, and bring in both .ai files as a smart objects.</li>
        <li>Find an image and bring it in photoshop as background layer.</li>
        <li>Use Blending Mode and Adjustment Filter on both the ai object and the image to create a balanced amount of contrast between the two different visual styles.</li>
        <li>Save and upload your final file into a jpg file and upload to Tumblr account.</li>
