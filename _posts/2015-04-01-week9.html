    <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Design-Design-Skills-tutorials/Hyphenation-justification/106698/121864-4.html">Hyphenation and justification</a>
    <p>Justified lines, which are aligned on both the left and the right, are created by varying the word spacing in each line. This is controlled by hyphenation and justification settings, which are called H and Js for short. Hyphenation settings in design programs, such as InDesign and Illustrator control how many letters occur before or after a hyphen. Hyphens help regulate word spacing by allowing for word breaks. I'll talk about the principles and the desired results of good word spacing, so you'll know what to look for.</p>
    <br><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Design-Design-Skills-tutorials/Indents-outdents-hanging-punctuation/106698/121865-4.html">Indents, Outdents, and hanging punctuations</a>
    <p>The width of the indent should be enough to be easily visible based on the line length. One pica is a good starting point. Another way to indicate paragraphs is the out dent. These will need a wider left-hand margin, so the out dents are not too close to the edge of the page. If space permits, you may also indicate paragraphs by skipping a line space or a half line space between paragraphs. An unusual and more dramatic method is a very wide indent.</p>

    <br><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Design-Design-Skills-tutorials/How-legibility-readability-differ/106698/121872-4.html">Legibility and Readability</a>
    <p>In typographic terms legibility measures how easy or difficult it is to see the differences between one letter of a typeface and another. This is a function of the type's design. The most legible typefaces have individual character shapes which are clearly defined from one another.</p>
    <br><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Design-Design-Skills-tutorials/Hierarchy-functionality/106698/121874-4.html">Hierarchy and Functionality</a>
    <p>It Show the viewer what to read first, second third, and so on. Creating hierarchy is simple. Size and weight matter most, color and contrast and position in the composition matter too. Creating visual prominence and setting priorities for the viewer is something you can do.</p>
    <br><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Design-Design-Skills-tutorials/Paragraphs-drop-caps-entry-points/106698/121876-4.html">Paragraphs, Drop Caps, and Enty points</a>
    <p>To get the reader interested, I encourage you to try some of these simple methods for creating introductory paragraphs and drop caps. It's easy to be a good design host by inviting the reader in. Think of it as offering the reader a tasty cocktail to entice them to hang out at your party. It's a good thing. </p>
