    <h2>Interaction Design - Prototyping</h2>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Storyboard</h3>
    <p>What is a storyboard? And what kind of design benefit from a storyboarding process? 
A storyboard is a graphic organizer in the form of illustrations or images displayed in sequence for the purpose of pre-visualizing a motion picture,animation, motion graphic or interactive media sequence. The storyboarding process, in the form it is known today, was developed at Walt Disney Productions during the early 1930s, after several years of similar processes being in use at Walt Disney and other animation studios. One advantage of using storyboards is that it allows (in film and business) the user to experiment with changes in the storyline to evoke stronger reaction or interest. Flashbacks, for instance, are often the result of sorting storyboards out of chronological order to help build suspense and interest. </p>

        <p>Use How to create a storyboard? You can hand-draw low-fidelity storyboard on paper and digitize it. Web applications like<a href="https://www.storyboardthat.com/storyboard-creator">storyboard this</a> can also assist with creating a digital narrative. It can be a comic book project you've always wanted to explore, or a concept you had for a video game, an art installation, a cellphone app you are interested in exploring. See below for inspirations and examples.</p>

    <h3>Wireframe</h3>
    <p>What is wireframe and what kind of design benefit from an wire-framing process? Wireframes are simple black and white layouts that outline the specific size and placement of page elements, site features, conversion areas and navigation for your web site. They are devoid of color, font choices, logos or any real design elements that take away from purely focusing on a siteâ€™s structure. We often say that they are much like a blue print to a home, where you can easily see the structural placement of your plumbing, electrical and other structural elements without any interior design treatments. Wireframing is very helpful in a multitude of ways. Your designs are more calculated and streamlined. Content creation becomes much clearer. You avoid hacks later on in the design process. You avoid situations where you spend hours crafting a specific screen design only to realize that it's not relevant to your overall user flow much later on during the design process.</p>

    <h2>Assignment - Prototyping for Interaction Design</h2>
    <p>Depending on if you are making a commercial(functional) web/app mockup, or a narrative based mockup, choose one of the following prototyping approaches to make a 4-6 page low-fidelity wireframe and bring it on Monday. At the initial prototyping stage, it is very important to focus on the overall narrative, user interaction and follow. Don't think too much about the details yet.  Also, if you think your app will benefit from both a storyboard and a wireframe, prototype with both. If you have digital creatives you created in the past, ie., photos you have taken, paintings you have drawn, illustrator/photoshop designs, and you would like to use them to mock up your final project, make sure you bring them on next class. During class, we will work on visual mockup together based on the wireframe/storyboard you have created.</p>
