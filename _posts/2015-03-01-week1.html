    <h2>What's good graphic design?</h2>

    <h5>Form, Feeling, Function</h5>
    <p>In order to exhibit good form, a design must be visually appealing to the audience with a good color palate and have well thought out typography. And while aesthetics are one of the main things that come to mind when we talk about graphic design, they're definitely not the only piece to the puzzle. Steve Jobs once said that design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
        <br> One of the other pieces that help make it work is the feeling. When we talk about the feeling of a design, we're referring to whether or not the design stays on message. If there's consistency in the mood that it creates and whether or not that mood evokes the proper emotional response from the intended audience. Donald A Norman once said, Everything has a personality. Everything sends an emotional signal. Even where this was not the intention of the designer, the people who view the website infer personalities and experience emotions. Now he's specifically referencing websites here, but this is true for all designs. And we have to be aware of this as designers and learn to effect and guide the emotions of those who view our work.
        <br> The final element in the F3 rule is function. Function refers to how something works and whether or not it serves its intended purpose. That means being easy to read and understand and also that the form is executable within the given medium in which it was presented. For instance, is this artwork reproducible in billboard form? Will this typeface work on this packaging design, et cetera. One of my favorite quotes on function, which sadly I'm unable to attribute, says, form without function is just a pretty sheet of paper.
