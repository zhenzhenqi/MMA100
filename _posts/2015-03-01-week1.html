    <h2>What's good graphic design?</h2>
    <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/What-makes-design-great/161817/177322-4.html">http://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/What-makes-design-great/161817/177322-4.html</a>
    <h5>Form, Feeling, Function</h5>
    <p>In order to exhibit good form, a design must be visually appealing to the audience with a good color palate and have well thought out typography. And while aesthetics are one of the main things that come to mind when we talk about graphic design, they're definitely not the only piece to the puzzle. Steve Jobs once said that design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
        <br> One of the other pieces that help make it work is the feeling. When we talk about the feeling of a design, we're referring to whether or not the design stays on message. If there's consistency in the mood that it creates and whether or not that mood evokes the proper emotional response from the intended audience. Donald A Norman once said, Everything has a personality. Everything sends an emotional signal. Even where this was not the intention of the designer, the people who view the website infer personalities and experience emotions. Now he's specifically referencing websites here, but this is true for all designs. And we have to be aware of this as designers and learn to effect and guide the emotions of those who view our work.
        <br> The final element in the F3 rule is function. Function refers to how something works and whether or not it serves its intended purpose. That means being easy to read and understand and also that the form is executable within the given medium in which it was presented. For instance, is this artwork reproducible in billboard form? Will this typeface work on this packaging design, et cetera. One of my favorite quotes on function, which sadly I'm unable to attribute, says, form without function is just a pretty sheet of paper.

    <h2>Layout and Composition</h2>
    <p> There are hundreds of terms used to describe what we do as designers and just as many philosophies about the way we work, but we all share this: our job as designers is to create clear communication. This is achieved with typography, images, and shape. The combination of these elements can be aesthetically pleasing or repulsive. A layout based on consistent proportions and a grid is more likely to succeed than one that is haphazard and confused.
        <br>As human beings, we look instinctively for pattern and meaning. With the exception of a few people on hoarding reality shows, most of us organize our world to make sense. We put the towels with the other towels in the linen closet. We don't put some in the freezer and others under the bed. We organize our books by subject, author, or color. These actions make life more manageable. This is the core idea of a grid and consistent proportions. The grid helps the designer organize the information with hierarchy and order.
        <br>Consistent proportions provide a visual sense of unity and clarity. A grid is the same as the steel frame of a building underneath the walls and windows. It holds the structure together without being dominant. When we apply a grid to a project, the elements are arranged in a way that makes sense. The text is placed consistently and images relate to each other in scale. Now, imagine a world without grids and consistent proportions.</p>

    <h2>Technical Guide</h2>
    <img src="{{ '/img/week1/grid.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="img-responsive">
    <p> Columns guide the content vertically. You can create one column, two columns, or 20 columns. It's entirely up to you. Hanglines help the reader understand the real estate of a page. They provide a guide to hang content consistently, horizontally. Gutters provide space between the columns.

        <br>This helps the reader delineate the area of one column of type from another. If they are too tight, the reading is difficult. If they are too wide, the information will appear to be unrelated. Markers are the elements that remain the same on every page. Page numbers, or folios as some people call them, running feet, or running heads. You can place the text in one column, or two. The images are scaled to whatever size you want within the columns.

        <br>You can create an asymmetrical, or symmetrical layout. The grid is just a structure, not a hard line set of rules. You can follow it as rigidly as you'd like, or as loosely as you like. Now it's up to you to breathe life in to a very simple structure.</p>
