    <h2>Branding - Visual Identity</h2>
    <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/What-logo-design/112674/140478-4.html">What's logo design</a>
    <p>A logo is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol commonly used by commercial enterprises, organizations and even individuals to aid and promote instant public recognition. Logos are either purely graphic (symbols/icons) or are composed of the name of the organization (a logotype or wordmark). A logo is not a brand, but a logo is most definitely the capstone in the arch of any brand. Logo design is all about developing and creating an engaging personality through visual identity. When done well it will effectively represent and communicate your client's brand to their audience.</p>
