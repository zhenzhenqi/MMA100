    <h2>Branding - Visual Identity</h2>
    <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/What-logo-design/112674/140478-4.html">What's logo design</a>
    <p>A logo is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol commonly used by commercial enterprises, organizations and even individuals to aid and promote instant public recognition. Logos are either purely graphic (symbols/icons) or are composed of the name of the organization (a logotype or wordmark). A logo is not a brand, but a logo is most definitely the capstone in the arch of any brand. Logo design is all about developing and creating an engaging personality through visual identity. When done well it will effectively represent and communicate your client's brand to their audience.</p>

    <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/Good-logo-attributes/112674/140506-4.html">What makes a good logo?</a>
    <p>Is it Unique? Is it identifiable? Is it conceptually strong? Is it scalable? Is it reproducible on paripherial products? Does it work as a good Favicon?</p>
    <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/Gauging-perceptions/112674/140482-4.html">Gauging your Client</a>
    <p>Making first contact with a client is kind of like, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. At first, you are unfamiliar with the species, and you need to determine if it's going to abduct your time and resources, or be a good fit for your business. Many people, myself included, Have made the mistake of ignoring tell-tail signs because we didn't want to turn down any work. Gauging perception is one of the first things you want to do.
        <br><br>Ask yourself these questions when approached by a new potential client. Does this client have unrealistic expectations? Does this client appreciate and value creative work? Do I align with this client's business goals and services? Does this client view us as a mere extension of their arm? These questions and more will help you evaluate if you should move forward with a client, or at least clarify need to look closer at areas of your creative relationship, and address them ahead of time to avoid problems later on.</p>
    <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/Quoting-project/112674/140485-4.html">Quoting a project</a>
    <p>The most important thing to do when quoting any design project is to itemize all the deliverables. What you're going to create and how much you'll be paid to create it. Nothing about a quote should be vague. It should be all clearly defined so both parties fully understand what it includes, and how much it'll cost without any doubt on either end. Here's an example of a quote form I use with my own clients. Most larger agencies in general, contact me with a budget already in mind, and usually ask, we need X, and can you do it for this amount? Sometimes the price is fair, but most often they're trying to be cheap, and I have to counteroffer with a more realistic fee.</p>
    <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/Establishing-terms-agreements/112674/140486-4.html">Drafting Terms and Conditions</a>
    <p>The purpose of having a contract is to protect yourself. Some creatives call it a contract, others refer to it as a work agreement. And some just itemize the deliverables on a provided quote and have the client sign off on it to green-light a project. Whatever you call it, never start a project without having a signed agreement ever. The point is to have the mutual understanding and clear communication between you and the client. By this I mean the clarity on what you're hired to create, how much they'll pay you to create it. <br><br>How many rounds of revisions are included, what are the usage rights to the work being created? Who owned the final products when it's done and if it's okay to display the work you create on your own website, once it's public? I'd like to say I've never have issues on this arena but that wouldn't be true. I've learned the hard way. So, I highly recommend you start putting your design projects in writing and let your client sign off on them before you invest any of your time to work on them. This may not be creative oriented work, but it's part of running a smart, creative bussiness.</p>

    <br><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/Crafting-visual-identity-Shape-form-details/112674/140509-4.html">attention to detail</a>
    <p>Think on a pixel level when designing logo and logo typefaces. The other aspect of working on logos that we want to pay attention to is shape and form, and various aspects of detailing. So, what I want to talk about in terms of shape and form is, many times when you're working on a logo project like this one. I'm going to zoom in so you can see this a lot better. This was the name of this client was Package Genie. So we're playing off of that whole concept of the genie. And the services they're offering has to do with mailing packages, so obviously the genie is playing a part in making that service easy.</p>
